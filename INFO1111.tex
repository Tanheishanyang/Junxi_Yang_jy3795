Level A: Initial Understanding

1.1.	Level A Demonstration
Install Unity and configure the conditions required to run the C# language in VScode.
Create a first-person view of a character and allow that character to move.
Create and assign variables in C#. Define and call functions in C#

1.2.	Learning Approach
Firstly, I made a small plan. The plane includes some instruction for learning unity.
Most of my learning resources come from www.bilibili.com
Then I started my project.Firstly, I learned how to download unity Hub and select the correct version for macbook.Secondly,I foollowed the steps in the learning video form www.bilibili.com
Lastly,when I think I have reached the basic step of creating my project,I started editting the porject and save it as the unity porfile.

1.3.	Challenges and Di	culties
The biggest problem I'm having right now is that there's a huge difference between what the preview file looks like and what the exported file looks like. I studied it for a long time but I still don't know how to solve it. The problem with this is that the terrain in the game simply disappears and the characters start falling indefinitely
